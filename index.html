        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mukudzei Chisenwa. I am studying web development for my associate's degree. My professional goal is
          to become a skilled web developer, specializing in creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications that
          enhance user experiences. I am learning more about programming and development tools to prepare for future career
          opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Why I am Taking This Class</h2>
        <p>I am taking this JavaScript course to strengthen my foundation in programming concepts. JavaScript is the most widely
          used language for web development, and learning it will help me create interactive websites. I want to better
          understand variables, functions, and how to manipulate the DOM so I can build more interactive websites and be
          prepared for real-world projects.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Reflections & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>I plan to practice JavaScript fundamentals regularly, use Git for version control, and commit my progress to GitHub.
          This will help me grow my skills and keep track of my learning journey.</p>
